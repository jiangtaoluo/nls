# nls
name lable switching paradigm, a mpls-like architecture for named data networks. Pls ref to the paper published in IEEE Communications Letters, "Jiangtao Luo, Chao Wu, Yi Jiang and Jingwen Tong, Name Label Switching Paradigm in Named Data Networking, IEEE Communications Letters, 19(3):335-338, 2015.03 DOI: 0.1109/LCOMM.2014.2387344"
Note: currently, the NLS patach can only be used with ndnsim 1.0. You just need to do:  
1.	Put the directory nls/ into ndndim1.0/ns-3/src;
2.	Put nls sample script nls-test.cc into the directory ndnsim1.0/ns-3/scratch;
3.	Goto ndnsim1.0/ns-3, recompile the ndnsim.
